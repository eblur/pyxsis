===========================================

pyXsis = Python X-ray Spectral Interpretation System

This is a toy python code for manipulating high resolution X-ray
Spectra.

This python library owes it's inspiration to the `Interactive Spectral
Interpretation System
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ASPC..216..591H>`_ written
by J. Houck and J. Davis (creator of S-lang), as well as long-time
users and contributors M. Nowak, J. Wilms, and the group at Remeis
Observatory. Thank you also to the entire Chandra HETG group at MIT
for personal help throughout the years with interpreting high
resolution X-ray spectra.
