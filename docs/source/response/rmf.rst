Redistribution Matrix File (RMF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Redistribution Matrix File (frequenty referred to simply as
**RMF**) describes the probability distribution of detector pulse
heights that arise when a photon interacts with the detector. It is a
2D matrix with the pulse height distribution as a function of incoming
photon energy. Seee the `CXC documentation page on RMFs <https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/rmf.html>`_
